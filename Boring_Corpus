Transcription for American Express tape 1: A 4-24-89


My name is B C and I would like to plan a trip

 [charge number]

 and the date you need to leave?

well um I have to work a little bit backwards here

 ok

I want to leave on the first flight out of ORD uh Monday morning

 M- Monday (the first

the eighth) the eighth

 ok 

and I want to take whatever red eye or any other flight that I have to take
to get there in time to make that transfer

 where are you going from Chicago to where?

Greenbay. so the first I need to catch the first flight from ORD out
to Greenbay, Wisconsin uh Monday morning

 it looks like the first one is a seven forty on American uh Eagle that
 arrives Greenbay at eight fifty one

is that booked?

 I do show space avaliable

ok

 uh, let's see what would get you there then leaving probabl- the seventh.
 from San Jose or San Francisco?

San Francisco. actually Oakland would be good too on that

 I don't know if there are any red eyes from there (let's see

ok)

 there is one on United that leaves Oakland at eleven thirty p.m. and
 arrives Chicago five twenty five a.m.

so that's a two hour hold there

 yes 

waiting for that flight ok any others?

 uh not from Oakland. departing from San Francisco it's about the same
 actually American has an eleven forty one flight from San Francisco
 that arrives Chicago five fifty four (and

that's ) and hour and a half. so that's that's a a wash

 yeah or wait just one moment. or United has a twelve oh one a.m.
 departure that arrives at Chicago five fifty two a.m.

oh that sounds good

 it's about the same I don't know if you prefer United over American or ??

I'm a member of the United Travel

 oh ok

group, so let's book that midnight red eye out of SFO

 uh huh

right will leave SFO at

 I'm sorry just one moment
 ok put this in the correct order. so you'd be on United flight five two
 eight

United five twenty eight

 leaving on the eigth from San Francisco twelve oh one (a.m.

oh)

 is that right? arriving Chicago five fifty two
 and then you would connect with American flight four two oh eight leaving
 Chicago seven forty a.m. and arriving Greenbay eight fifty one

seven forty to eight fifty one. ok and

 that's actually operated by American Eagle

uh what's the name of that the flight number

 four two zero eight

four two zero eight ok

 all righty and from there?

 [car rental]

mh huh and I need a flight uh let's see I guess mid to late morning back uh

 from Greenbay to

Springfield, Illinois that's that's probably going to be via Chicago

 let's take a look and see what we have. ok United has a nine thirty
 seven connection through Chicago and you would conn- connect with an
 American flight that would arrive Springfield twelve thirty one

ok

 or you can take American both legs leaving at nine thirty two and connecting
 with the same flight 

all right so let's see it's only nine thirty seven to twelve thirty ( for
that trip

 mmm hmmmm)

that sounds good to me

 let me give you those flight numbers

ok

 that would be United flight two nine seven four
 that flight is operated by United Express Air Wisconsin and it leaves
 Greenbay nine thirty seven a.m. arrives Chicago ten thirty five, connects
 with American flight four three oh six. again that's operated by American
 Eagle leaving Chicago eleven twenty five and arriving Springfield
 twelve thirty one p.m.

uh that gives me half a day there Wednesday that's good

 [car and hotel]

 ok and then you're going to return from Chicago on the fourteen or

on the fourteenth right

 at what time?

umm think I'd like to arrive SFO around six in the evening, late afternoon
evening

 United has a three forty five nonstop that arrives San Francisco six oh
 three or they have a five p.m. that arrives seven eighteen

what's the next flight earlier than the the uh one that arrives

 there's a two fifty on American that arrives San Francisco five twenty
 five or a one o'clock on United that arrives San Francisco three fourteen

I think I'm going to do the one p.m. thing

 ok that would be United

let me let me let me beg your pardon here for a second I want to pull a map
Do you have any distances easily available in your computer there?

 um, just air mileage actually where were you thinking of from

well I want I've got I think it's either two or three hundred miles that I have
to drive if I'm going to come into ORD

 from Springfield

ah well no it's a different town but it's very very close to that

 let me ah ah a hundred and seventy five airmiles from Springfield to Chicago

all right I've got my auto club map

 if you have yeah that's probably better it would give you the

all right let me, what have I got. I've got about two hundred and fifty miles
that's five hours of driving. I want to book the um I want to book
the three what is it three p.m. or so United flight out of Chicago

 ok that would be United f- it leaves at three forty five United flight one
 two nine

United one twenty nine and it leaves at three

 three forty five and arrives San Francisco six oh three

and

 you want me to price this and see what we get for the lowest available
 fare just one moment

all right this is two weeks in advance so it should be

 yeah and you are staying over a Saturday night so we should be able to do
 something here. uh it's taking a moment not sure why

 [mileage plus and car numbers]


 ok I can send your United number to Hertz also um I'm just looking at
 this fare we got back the lowest available would be six hundred and
 sixty dollars round trip that is completely non refundable and the
 last day to issue the ticket would be today because it has a fourteen
 day advance purchase

so that is that is the discounted fare then

 yes and that's that's the the lowest

ok

 we would have to issue the ticket today and it would be completely non
 refundable

uh huh

 and if you want to go with that or we could look at er er portions of
 your trip going to change or would you like to look at a fare that has a

well barring some major catastrophe no it won't change

 so would you like me to go ahead and set this up to ticket today?

yes

 ok (and

I've I've) always wondered if I get bumped on one of these legs because
I am flying two different airlines is that going to foul up my ticketing

 no if if for for their reasons you mean (they

say American Airlines)

 oversold the flight or something

American Eagle or whoever it is bumps me off a flight is United going to
penalize me?

 no 

ok

 [seating]

ok that's real fine

 all righty

all right thank you (very much

 thanks.) ok bye bye

bye bye


 -----


 um is this going to be business or personal?

this is business and uh

 [retrieving profile]

 and what date did you want to leave

I'm going to be leaving May first

 from San Jose or San Francisco?

uh it looks like San Jose tell you what I what I need I have an appointment
Monday afternoon at San Bernadino and uh I have appointments on Tuesday
um in the City Commerce and in the Santa Ana areas so 

 mm hmm

it looks like probably the best connections are to go out to Ontario and
to come back by way of Orange County I don't know if you split that up
whether that's gonna

 it won't it really won't affect the cost um except that if we issue the
 ticket today we can get you a seven day advance purchase

mm hmm

 fare that's gonna be two fifty eight round trip instead of two ninety

mm hmm

 six

mm hmm

 but uh otherwise un- unless you're staying over a Saturday night

unfortunately no I ??

 ok and what time do you need to be in San Bernadino by?

I need to uh well my appointment is at two o'clock so it looks like I I
just looked at the airline guide it looks like there are two American
Airlines flights out of San Jose ah one's at nine fifty gets in around
eleven oh two and the other nine twenty five it gets in at ten thirty

 that's on Alaska

is that Alaska?

 yeah

ah both of them?

 no American is the nine fifty flight

nine fifty is American uh huh are there price differences depending on

 no it would be the same airfare it's just up to you which time would be
 better or if you have a preference (to airlines

they're both in) the middle of the morning so

 yeah

equally non productive uh

 it shouldn't be ba- too bad traffic wise

yeah I guess Alaska has a snack on it and American doesn't um

 would you rather fly on the Alaska flight?

well p- p- put me on the American that's a little later that's the nine
fifty you say?

 uh huh

yeah put me on the American flight

 ok that's flight fourteen thirteen and it leaves San Jose nine fifty a.m.

yeah

 and arrives Ontario eleven oh two

eleven oh two ok

 ok and then what date would you be returning?

be returning on the second

 at what time?

and uh my last appointment is again two o'clock in the afternoon
I would imagine we could depart around five five or six

 and you wanted to leave from Orange County, correct?

I think so yeah the appointment going to be right near Orange County

 ok American has a five p.m. flight

that sounds

 or they have a six p.m.

the fourteen ninety six is the five right

 uh huh

um yeah I'd almost I'd almost say uh the five ought to be able to do it um 

 the only um let me just go ahead and price this and double check but yeah
 you would be eligible for the two fifty eight fare but the ticket would
 need to be issued today

mm hmm

 so if you want to change that return you'd have to give me a call by this
 afternoon or unless you wanted to go with the fare that had no penalty
 which would be two ninety six

ok in other words if I change the return then I'm 

 you need to do so by by (this afternoon

ok it's not something) that I could uh if I if I changed en route er while I
was there that would be a penalty

 yo- yeah then it would be a twenty five percent penalty

yeah I I suspect that uh I suspect the uh five o'clock is ok but maybe to be on
the safe side we better do the six

 ok

if we wind up having a productive meeting I'd hate to have to push it
short for twenty five percent penalty included

 yeah tha- that's true

uh huh

 ok I can confirm you on the six o'clock flight which is flight three six two

 [car rental]

 so do you want to go ahead with the six p.m. departure then?

 [coughing]

I believe so yes

 ok and we want to go ahead with the two hundred and fifty eight dollar
 fare that (has the twenty five

if that's the best) we can do. what, just for curiosity if you stayed over
Saturday what are the rates?

 well we could get it down to a hundred and twenty four dollars round trip

round trip ok (?? efforts

 but that w- but that would be completely non refundable

no no changes ??

 yeah no changes on a a if if worst now the only thing is that I do need
 to have the um charge number and the travel advance before we can issue
 (the ticket today

 [ticketing]

A thank you so much

 ok thanks

bye bye

 bye bye

the twenty second and he needs to be there in time for an evening meeting
if he can be, say around six o'clock

 let me see here

twenty second of June did I make that clear?

 yeah a- I assumed that yeah. ah there's nothing really that gets in that
 early. uh Air Canda has a connection through Toronto that leaves San
 Francisco at seven fifty a.m. arrives Toronto at three thirty five but
 the connection to Ottawa doesn't leave until five fifteen getting into
 Ottawa at six ten (and

when)

 that's about the earliest one

um ok

 other than leaving the evening before. I mean the, you know like just
 after midnight

so we have one tha- on Air Canada that goes to Toronto huh?

 right and then it's a change of planes there but it doesn't arrive into
 Ottawa until six ten

let me take all that down anyway ok I guess it's too, at what time does it
get to Toronto?

 ah three thirty five p.m.

 ah yes one second

 ah only if there's an overnight direct flight on Piedmont but it leaves
 leaves the night before at eleven forty p.m.

let me see I'm writing this down. that's Piedmont what

 ah flight twelve fifty it really isn't worth considering I just noticed
 it makes three (stops

no) no

 I mean it's direct in that it's the same plane all the way through but
 ( it's ??

??) going to take him all night

 there are no non stop flights (um

that's) what I was wondering ok

 there's a CP Air f- uh connection through Vancouver it get's in later it
 leaves at nine ten a.m. and arrives Vancouver (at 

what) is CP Air?

 it's a Canadian Airline like Air Canada it's

and it flies out of San Francisco?

 uh huh

huh what's that number then?

 uh it's CP Air flight one forty

one forty

 it's out of San Francisco at nine ten a.m.

uh huh

 arrives Vancouver at eleven thirteen a.m. it connects to CP Air flight
 seven twenty two

mm hmm

 that leaves Vancouver at one p.m. and arrives Ottawa at nine forty eight
 p.m. that does make one stop between Vancouver and Ottawa

where does it stop?

 let's see. looks like Calgary

like Calgary ok

 yeah, Calgary

all right then coming back if if you ha- do you have a late flight out on the
twenty third. probably not huh?

 well let me see. we might cause the time zone's in our v- our favor
 coming (this direction

uh huh) he said either l- late on the twenty third or or any time on the
twenty fourth

 ok. by late he means something like nine ten like that?
 cause there's an eight p.m. departure

tha- ah I think that's (that's

 would) that be good?

uh huh

 ok there's an eight p.m. departure on Air Canada it's flight four sixty
 seven it arrives into Toronto at eight fifty five connects to Air Canada
 flight seven fifty five that's out of Toronto at ten thirty p.m. and
 arrives San Francisco at twelve forty five a.m. on the twenty fourth

no I'm it leaves Ottawa four sixty seven leaves Ottawa at what time?

 eight p.m.

eight p.m. and arrives at Toronto

 eight fifty five

eight fifty five. and leaves Toronto at ten thirty?

 right

(and arrives

 seven fifty) five does

mm huh

 and arrives San Francisco at twelve forty five a.m.

ok and then what about Saturday a flight next Saturday?

 yeah one second. uh there's an early Air Canada connection through Toronto
 again

uh huh

 it's uh flight one eighty nine out of Ottawa at six fifty a.m. arrives
 Toronto at seven forty seven a.m.

mmm hmm

 connects to Air Canada flight seven fifty seven

mm hmm

 out of Toronto at nine thirty a.m.

mm hmm

 and arrives San Francisco at eleven forty five a.m.

all right I think tha- this is enough for him to consider

 ok

for the time being and I'll get back with you

 ok great

all right thank you ( very much

 thanks a lot)

bye bye

 her reservations sometimes you have to make it directly with the airline

oh

 and if we can make it I'll go ahead and do it

oh ok

 ok otherwise you'll have to call US Air

oh I see all right now coming back on June twentieth

 leaving at what time?

you'll have to check that one too

 no I'll check the whole thing yeah

mmm

 what's his wife's name?

 [trying to figure out pronunciation, hotel, car]

ah huh

 yeah we have enough advance purchase time that i can get a nonrefundable
 fare on the return would bring that portion down to twenty nine dollars
 one way but I'd have to t- issue the tickets today

 non restrictive air fare) one ninety eight right

 Hi this is A at American Express may I help you?

hi A this is B Physical Sciences Business Office at uh WWW

 [recording notification]

 yeah and uh what can I help you with?

uh I need to know uh business class round trip uh fare for ah San Francisco
to ah Baron, Switzerland

 sure one second. is this for a proposal?

right

 I'm checking a couple different carriers just to compare them before I give
 you the fare on this

ok

 I seem to have a very slow computer here

ok that's all right

 well I have one fare let me give you that and I'm just trying to see if I
 can verify it on another carrier

ok

 uh one way fare would be fifteen sixty seven

w- round trip?

 the round trip would be that times two plus thirteen for taxes

ok

 [reiteration of fare]

 ah it looks like approximately right uh using TWA instead of American I get
 fifteen eighty nine a little bit higher

ok

 so it's it's in that ballpark (??

ok fifteen) fifty seven times two plus thirteen

 there isn't any one carrier that flies all the way in there you need
 to connect somewhere like from TWA to Air France or Pan Am to Air France
 or something to get in to Baron

uh huh

 and also you can't get business class all the way through but they fare
 it business class all the way

ok

 you you you would get business class from the US to your European gateway
 city and then for the little hop to Baron you would probably be in Coach

yeah ok

 ok

that helps

 ok great

thanks a lot

 you're welcome (bye bye

bye bye

Copenhagen from San Francisco to Los Angeles and he is going on a two
o'clock flight.

 [ticketing]

 he's going to Copenhagen today?

that's correct yes

 [warning her of slow system]

 it's just a flat one way?

ah yes that's correct

 in business class?

 [sentence fragments]

ok (??

 yeah we should be able to do it)

 [discussion of international booking]

 um) one sec let me just

all right

 start a new reservation for him. what's his last name?

um C [spells name]

 first name

D [spells name]

 [discussing non-employee status, charge number, etc.]

 ok what flights do you want to have him on?

ok he would like to be on United flight one one one seven

 first of all he's going all the way through to Copenhagen?

oh, that's right uh huh

 and this is a connection in what city?

ah Los Angeles

 ok

oh and yeah

 and what time does that United flight leave?

it's ah going out at uh two o'clock today, SFO to Los Angeles

 and then connecting to SAS flight nine thirty two?

nine thirty two that's right

 and you said well actually the eleven seventeen I'm showing sold out let
 me just look (in their system

oh no)

 well we can put him there are other flights oh there I can get a seat on it

oh ok

 ?? it's one of the last ones but I can get it.
 now is he going business class on the SAS flight?

um if he can go business class sure

 they're allowed it for flights over (thirteen hours

certainly oh) ok great that's fine

 and this is just going to be one way only right?

that's correct

 [on hold, hotel, passport, seating, check in]

 ok B so I have him on United flight eleven seventeen on today Friday
 the twenty sixth out of San Francisco at two p.m.

right

 arriving LAX at three fifteen p.m.

uh huh

right 

 out of LAX at five thirty p.m. it arrives Copenhagen at one oh five p.m. on
 the twenty seventh of May

yes (that's wonderf-

 that's) on request and that's already confirmed so that's (great

that's) just absolutely marvelous and I am wondering now if we can we add
another leg to that uh

 what do you want to do?

 [on hold]

um we would like on Monday which would be uh let's see the twenty ninth the
holiday

 mm hmm

May twenty ninth from Copenhagen to uh Sandestrom

 ok

and that would be uh SAS flight two nine one and that is a ten thirty a.m.
departure

 ok no- this adds a fare that isn't in my system

oh

 so if we do that I'm going to have to send it off to the airlines for
 faring and I can't guarantee how fast they'll come back with a fare

 [ticketing problem]

y- exactly yes I understand. ok that's great and you did make the
